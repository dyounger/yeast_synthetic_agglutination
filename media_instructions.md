## How to make media for SynAg:

### YPAD (to make 800mL)
###### Mix the following:
- Bacto yeast extract: 8g
- Bacto peptone: 16g
- Adenine hemisulfate: 64mg
###### Fill to 720mL with DI water -> autoclave
###### Add 80mL of filter sterilized 20% dextrose for a final concentration of 2% dextrose


### YPAG: Identical to YPAD, but replace dextrose with galactose (still 80mL of 20% galactose for 800mL batch)


### SDO (to make 800mL)
###### Mix the following:
- Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids: 5.36g
- Adenine hemisulfate: 64mg
- Synthetic DO media (can be purchased with different drop out combinations which require adding different amounts. Add as recommended by manufacturer)
###### Fill to 720mL with DI water -> autoclave
